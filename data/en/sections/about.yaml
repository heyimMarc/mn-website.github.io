summary: 'My name is Marc Nützel, and I am a software engineer from Mülheim, Germany, who is specialized in building web applications in Java environments. Writing code is my hobby and my passion, I love most of the approaches of Robert C. Martin’s book ‘Clean Code’. Test-driven development is the way I prefer to build applications.
